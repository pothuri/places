Ideally these horses need to be on a diet of 2.5 kgs of wheat bran a day 🌾. which kinda was a lot for their owners to afford with tourism taking a toss, leading to about 150 horses being abandoned . However horses being intelligent found themselves the Maidan which is Kolkatas biggest play ground with enough feed for them to get on. So they head there during the day and navigate themselves back to their owners late in the evening, loyal that they are ❤️ 🙂 🐴 \n.\n@mojindia \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#maidan #kolkata #westbengal #instagramreels #kolkatadiaries #travelmatcha #horses"

"🏔 Acclimatization: This is probably the single most important thing to do while visiting Leh. It cannot be neglected, and successful acclimatization will help you have a comfortable trip. \n📝 What is acclimatization? : It is a process in which your body’s adjusts itself to newer altitudes, weather, humidity and pH. This process takes about a day or 2. Cannot stress enough on the fact how important this is. \n😷 Failing to acclimatize may lead to acute mountain sickness. \n💦 Stay hydrated, sleep early at night, stay at the same altitude. If feeling uneasy take medicines prescribed by your doctor. \n🌊 The elevation of Leh is at roughly 3500 meters, if taking a flight directly into Leh would require about 2 days of acclimatisation. \n🚗 This can further be neutralised if you visit Leh via road from Manali or Srinagar (in this case you’d be naturally acclimatising all along the way) \n💫 During this phase of acclimatization one can cover all the local sites around Leh. \nNote ⚠️: With increase in altitude things can get very serious , hence before you go to Ladakh you need to be aware of what altitude sickness is and how to prevent it. \n✅ Itinerary: While designing your itinerary follow a certain pattern where you visit places at a lower altitude first and leave  places like Tsomoriri for the end. \n✔️ I’ve made a detailed itinerary keeping this into consideration (please check my previous posts) \n#acclimatization #leh #lehladakh #travelmatcha #explurger #travelreels #mountains #india"

"The Daulatabad Fort had a significant role to play in the History of the Deccan peninsular . It was considered significant to capture Daulatabad to establish rule over the Deccan. Infact it stands as one the most important forts in the history of medieval India. \nHence it also served as the capital of the Delhi Sultanate established by Muhammed Bin Tughluq in 1328. And henceforth played an important roll in governing the Deccan province of India under various rulers. The fort was however originally built in 1187 by the Yadava dynasty and then taken over by the Khilji Dynasty . The Delhi Sultanate however fortified the original fort to its present day complex.\n\n🏰There are a few 100 reasons why this fort was impenetrable. \n🚪It doesn’t have a separate exit, just one entrance to confuse the enemy soldiers to drive deep into the fort to search for an exit. \n\n🦔Spikes in the gates- Pre Gunpowder era, elephants were used as battering ram to open up the gates, the spikes on these gates were intoxicated to ensure elephants died of injury.\n\n🏔The fort was built on a conical hill to ensure mountain lizards couldn’t be used as climbers \n\n🐊The internal alley ways were built to confuse the soldiers and trick them into falling into pools infested with crocodiles. \n\n⚔️The hill was cut by 50 m each side to improve defences. \n📝It was essential for any ruler in medieval India to get to Daulatabad to establish their rule over Southern India \n@maharashtratourismofficial \n‘You name it we have it’\n#maharashtraunlimited #daulatabad #daulatabadfort #aurangabad #createyourownstory #travelreels #fort #travel #chandminar #maharashtra"

This will save up space for that extra shopping to bring back home \n\n3. Underestimating the time needed for security clearance - Always arrive at the airport 2 hours prior for domestic flights and 3 hours prior for International flights. This will help you with longer queues during checking and security clearance. \n\n4.

Not Booking your excursions before hand: Booking your excursions error hand helps you skip long queues and gets you better rates (avoid last minute booking charges) \n\n7.

"Did you know Vietnam has a strong integrated French culture. \nVietnam  was colonised by France from 1887 to 1954, even more than 60 years later it’s easy to find French influence in the city. Here are 5 such influences. \n1) cuisine : French dishes like omelettes, baguettes, croissants and anything fried in butter have been infused with local ingredients. A few ingredients like cauliflower, zucchini and potatoes were introduced by the French. \n2) Architecture: French architecture is still prominent in the country in different regions with their high arches, balcony’s , columns and pleasing symmetries. \n3) Coffee: For the Vietnamese, coffee is their daily fuel, there’s 1000’s of coffee shops all over the country. However it wasn’t always like this, the Vietnamese were more tea drinkers (like China) before the French came. Today Vietnam is the 2nd largest exporter of coffee in the world. \n4) Bread: Unlike other South East Asian Countries, the Vietnamese like to eat their bread sandwiches. These are called “banh mi”\n5) Fashion and Education: The Vietnamese were always dressed in the ao dai and education was reserved for the elite. Under the French rule the education system became more westernised and fashion more European. \n#vietnam #french #vietnamtravel #hochiminh #travelmatcha #travelreels #asia #vietnamesefood #danang #vietnamesecuisine #creole #vietnamese #history #travelgram"
